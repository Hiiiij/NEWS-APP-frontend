# NEWS BEAT Frontend (WIP)

## Overview

**NEWS BEAT Frontend** is the user interface for **Go-Bot**, a lightweight AI-powered application that connects to OpenAI’s API. This Next.js-based frontend provides users with an interactive experience for fetching and interacting with news articles using AI-driven features.
The application allows users to browse curated news categories such as Featured, Business, and Technology, and enhances engagement through AI-powered chat capabilities. By leveraging Go-Bot’s backend, users can request summaries, conclusions, or even customize prompts to analyze news articles.

- **Dynamic Responses**: AI responses are tailored based on the user’s queries, making each interaction unique and insightful.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (React).
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS.
- **State Management**: Context API.
- **API Integration**: Axios for making RESTful API calls to fetch news and interact with the Go-Bot backend.
- **Deployment**: AWS.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhance AI Features**: Add more functionalities, such as opinion analysis and keyword extraction.
- **User Accounts**: Implement authentication to allow personalized recommendations.
- **Dark Mode**: Provide users with a toggle for light/dark theme preferences.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
